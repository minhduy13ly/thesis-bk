## Presentation Slide

## Notes
*  The report describes our teamwork, while the [slide](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEr9HNpOzs/BsVenMpMg9a5WHHjU6KEtw/edit?utm_content=DAEr9HNpOzs&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) only presents my tasks.
   * Referring to my work in the report, please look at sections 2.1-2.4, 4.1, 5.2 and appendix A-C.
   * Shared writing with my teammate: Chapters 1, 3 and 6. 
*  As we lack experience at the working time, the code is not well-structured. 
   We will refactor it if we have a chance in the future.
## Sample images

  mathematic method (bicubic).
